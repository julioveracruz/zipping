# Zipping your files
This repo is designed to be an example of working with potentially large folder(s) of data and preserve some precious storage on your machine. Specifically, users can use this repo to:
1. Compress a large folder into a ZIP file
1. Delete the original, uncompressed folder
1. Read through the ZIP file and its contents without opening it


This repo uses [shutil](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html) as well as [zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html) as primary libraries to operate on files and provide tools to work with ZIP files.
